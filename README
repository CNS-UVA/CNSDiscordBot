This bot can verify members of a discord using UVA's SAML. 
It runs a flask server to conduct the saml, and a discord bot to send users to the site and change their roles accordingly.

The Discord bot's token is expected to be in a file which has its name sest to the DISCORDTOKEN environment variable.

The bot will assign users the role assigned to the STUDENT_ROLE environment variable (default role name is Student) if they are a student.
and assign the role assigned to the STAFF_ROLE environment variable if they are a staff member.

Also, please set the CONTACT environment variable to the Discord username of someone who can give technical support if something goes wrong.

The bot is set up to DM users a link to auth.uvacns.com when they either join the server or type "!VerifyMe"
The link has a unique ID for each user that is linked back to their Discord account
When they successfully log in with UVA's SAML verification, the bot checks if UVA says that they are a student or staff and assigns them the appropriate roles.
The user is then linked back to auth.uvacns.com and told that they are verified on Discord! (and should contact the CONTACT person if something went wrong).

Also downloading python3-saml can be really annoying because xmlsec is stupid.
At least if you are on Ubuntu, make sure that you have pkg-config, libxml2-dev, libxmlsec1-dev, and libxmlsec1-openssl all apt installed and you should hopefully be able to build xmlsec.
